## MyForm Test Documentation
The `MyForm` test suite is designed to validate the behavior of a React form component using the React Testing Library. It begins with a utility function named fillForm to automate the process of filling in the form fields for multiple test cases. The tests are divided into two categories: Positive Test Cases and Negative Test Cases. Positive Test Cases focus on expected successful scenarios, ensuring that no error messages are displayed when the form is correctly filled out. In contrast, Negative Test Cases target scenarios where the user may fill the form incorrectly or leave out required fields, verifying that the appropriate error messages are displayed.

To run the tests locally:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. If not, you can install them using npm install or yarn install, depending on your package manager.
3. Run the test suite specific to MyFormComponent by executing the following command:
```bash
npm test
```
or
```bash
yarn test
```

Depending on your package manager. This will execute the tests and display the results in your terminal.
